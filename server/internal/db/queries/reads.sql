-- name: ListProjectsWithCounts :many
-- Project list used by the dashboard home. Joins enough aggregate info so the
-- UI renders without round-tripping per row.
--
-- Extra columns feed the card-style layout on /projects:
--   * provider: from the bound scm_source when present; empty string
--     when the project has no repo yet (shown as "—" in the UI).
--   * run_count: total runs across all pipelines — the card shows
--     "5 pipelines · 123 runs" as a density signal.
--   * status_agg: coarse health derived from the most recent run per
--     pipeline. Pre-computed in a CTE (latest_per_pipeline) so the
--     outer aggregate stays aggregate-only; correlated subqueries
--     inside CASE/WHEN during GROUP BY are fragile in Postgres and
--     blew up the previous version of this query.

-- Returns the tail (up to $2 lines) of a job's logs, oldest-first within the
-- returned window, so the UI can append-only render.

-- name: HeadLogLinesByJob :many
-- Returns the head (first $2 lines) of a job's logs in seq order.
-- Used together with TailLogLinesByJob to render the run detail's
-- log view as "first N + last M lines" — the verbose middle of
-- long jobs (Gradle test execution, kafka chatter) is rarely what
-- operators need first; the START (Gradle daemon setup, dependency
-- resolution from Nexus, classpath assembly) and the END (failure
-- + stack trace) are. Pre-v0.14.7 the cap-on-tail meant a 23k-line
-- job hid the entire startup; `kubectl logs` was the workaround.

-- name: CountLogLinesByJob :one
-- Total log line count for a job_run. Powers the "(N lines omitted)"
-- divider between head and tail in the UI: omitted = total - head -
-- tail, clamped to >= 0 (when head+tail overlap or exceed total,
-- callers dedupe and zero the omitted count). Cheap row count
-- against the same (job_run_id, seq) index TailLogLinesByJob hits.
